First version:index.html
How to use:
main.py: Use pandas and Google API to generate an Excel file (bars_info.xlsx) containing information such as "Address," "Longitude," "Latitude," "Name," and "Rating" of the places.
app.py: Run this code to combine with the index.html under the template folder, using the Flask framework to create a website displaying bars and their ratings.
3D Model in Master Branch: Open the 3D model from Google Maps in the times1.blend file to visualize the desired location.
Attention: An API key is required to run app.py and index.html.

Recognizing the inconvenience of requiring users to run Python scripts and acknowledging the suboptimal user interface, the introduction of bar1.html aims to simplify the user experience and eliminate the need for additional scripts.

Latest Version - bar1.html:
The newest version introduces a feature where, during your trip, the app can dynamically update nearby bars or clubs as you walk by. The updated version uses different colors to represent customer ratings, with green indicating the highest recommendation and red indicating the lowest. Recommendations update every few minutes and trigger notifications to enhance your exploration experience.
How to use:
All you need to do is to download the bar1.html, then a whole new journey is waiting for you!
